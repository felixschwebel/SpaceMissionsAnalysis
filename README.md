# SpaceMissionsAnalysis
A project to practice analyzing and visualizing data with Python using **Pandas**, **Plotly**, **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**. 

The dataset was scraped from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com) and includes all the space missions since the beginning of the **Space Race** between the USA and the Soviet Union in **1957 to August 7th, 2020**. 

First, I cleaned the data frame and converted the data to the required data types.

Then I visualized different properties that can be described by the scraped data. 

For example the *Number of Launches over Time by the Top 10 Organisations*:
